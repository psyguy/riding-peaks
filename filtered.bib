  abstract = {Diurnal rhythm complicates the acquisition of clinical laboratory samples by adding a predictable time-dependent component to the pre-analytical variation that, if not taken into account, degrades the clinical utility of results on certain analytes. Here we performed a systematic review of the literature and identified, in 56 publications that met our minimum inclusion criteria, 30 analytes that undergo diurnal variation. We graded the quality of evidence of these publications using a 3-tier scoring system of our own formulation. The rigor of the experimental design and agreement varied considerably across studies. Analyte concentration oscillated considerably over the 24-h day--night cycle. The median zenith-to-nadir change relative to the nadir concentration (\%ZNC) for the 30 analytes was 100\%. To set the magnitude of diurnal variation into perspective, we assessed the fluctuation in analyte concentration throughout the 24-h period (diurnal variation (\%CVdv)) relative to the day-to-day fluctuation determined at a fixed time during the 24-h period (within-subject biological variation (\%CVw)). Then we divided the \%CVdv by the published \%CVw to obtain a novel metric termed the diurnal variation index (DVI). The median DVI for the 16 analytes examined was 2.0, underscoring that, for most analytes, the diurnal variation was larger than the published \%CVw and highlighting the importance of adhering to protocols regulating the time of sampling when dealing with these analytes. Given that the \%CVw is the basis of the reference change value (RCV) and several quality metrics such as the Sigma metric (based on total allowable error), failure to regulate the time of sample collection will compromise these \%CVw-based targets. We also provide examples where failure to regulate the time of collection of diurnally changing analytes compromises their diagnostic utility. Nevertheless, for the most part, websites of major laboratories in the USA and Europe do not consistently stipulate collection at specified time junctures for the majority of the analytes identified here.},

  abstract = {Changes in levels of the stress-sensitive hormone cortisol from morning to evening are referred to as diurnal cortisol slopes. Flatter diurnal cortisol slopes have been proposed as a mediator between chronic psychosocial stress and poor mental and physical health outcomes in past theory and research. Surprisingly, neither a systematic nor a meta-analytic review of associations between diurnal cortisol slopes and health has been conducted to date, despite extensive literature on the topic. The current systematic review and meta-analysis examined associations between diurnal cortisol slopes and physical and mental health outcomes. Analyses were based on 179 associations from 80 studies for the time period up to January 31, 2015. Results indicated a significant association between flatter diurnal cortisol slopes and poorer health across all studies (average effect size, r=0.147). Further, flatter diurnal cortisol slopes were associated with poorer health in 10 out of 12 subtypes of emotional and physical health outcomes examined. Among these subtypes, the effect size was largest for immune/inflammation outcomes (r=0.288). Potential moderators of the associations between diurnal cortisol slopes and health outcomes were examined, including type of slope measure and study quality indices. The possible roles of flatter slopes as either a marker or a mechanism for disease etiology are discussed. We argue that flatter diurnal cortisol slopes may both reflect and contribute to stress-related dysregulation of central and peripheral circadian mechanisms, with corresponding downstream effects on multiple aspects of biology, behavior, and health.},

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

  abstract = {. Recent studies have shown that emotion dynamics such as inertia (i.e., autocorrelation) can change over time. Importantly, current methods can only detect either gradual or abrupt changes in inertia. This means that researchers have to choose a priori whether they expect the change in inertia to be gradual or abrupt. This will leave researchers in the dark regarding when and how the change in inertia occurred. Therefore in this article, we use a new model: the time-varying change point autoregressive (TVCP-AR) model. The TVCP-AR model can detect both gradual and abrupt changes in emotion dynamics. More specifically, we show that the inertia of positive affect and negative affect measured in one individual differs qualitatively in how it changes over time. Whereas the inertia of positive affect increased only gradually over time, negative affect changed both in a gradual and abrupt fashion over time. This illustrates the necessity of being able to model both gradual and abrupt changes in order to detect meaningful quantitative and qualitative differences in temporal emotion dynamics.},

  abstract = {Time series modeling is an effective approach for studying and analyzing the future performance of the power sector based on historical data. This study proposes a forecasting framework that applies a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous factors (SARIMAX) model to forecast the long-term performance of the electricity sector (electricity consumption, generation, peak load, and installed capacity). In this study, the model was used to forecast the aforementioned factors in Saudi Arabia for 30 years from 2021 to 2050. The historical data that were inputted into the model were collected from Saudi Arabia at quarterly intervals across a 40-year period (1980-2020). The SARIMAX technique applies a time series approach with seasonal and exogenous influencing factors, which helps reduce the error values and improve the overall model accuracy, even in the case of close input and output dataset lengths. The experimental findings indicated that the SARIMAX model has promising performance in terms of categorization and consideration, as it has significantly improved forecasting accuracy compared with the simpler autoregressive integrated moving average-based techniques. Furthermore, the model is capable of coping with different-sized sequential datasets. Finally, the model aims to help address the issue of a lack of future planning and analyses of power performance and intermittency, and it provides a reliable forecasting technique, which is a prerequisite for modern energy systems.},

  abstract = {Background Population mental health surveillance is an important challenge limited by resource constraints, long time lags in data collection, and stigma. One promising approach to bridge similar gaps elsewhere has been the use of passively generated digital data. Purpose This article assesses the viability of aggregate Internet search queries for real-time monitoring of several mental health problems, specifically in regard to seasonal patterns of seeking out mental health information. Methods All Google mental health queries were monitored in the U.S. and Australia from 2006 to 2010. Additionally, queries were subdivided among those including the terms ADHD (attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder); anxiety; bipolar; depression; anorexia or bulimia (eating disorders); OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder); schizophrenia; and suicide. A wavelet phase analysis was used to isolate seasonal components in the trends, and based on this model, the mean search volume in winter was compared with that in summer, as performed in 2012. Results All mental health queries followed seasonal patterns with winter peaks and summer troughs amounting to a 14\% (95\% CI=11\%, 16\%) difference in volume for the U.S. and 11\% (95\% CI=7\%, 15\%) for Australia. These patterns also were evident for all specific subcategories of illness or problem. For instance, seasonal differences ranged from 7\% (95\% CI=5\%, 10\%) for anxiety (followed by OCD, bipolar, depression, suicide, ADHD, schizophrenia) to 37\% (95\% CI=31\%, 44\%) for eating disorder queries in the U.S. Several nonclinical motivators for query seasonality (such as media trends or academic interest) were explored and rejected. Conclusions Information seeking on Google across all major mental illnesses and/or problems followed seasonal patterns similar to those found for seasonal affective disorder. These are the first data published on patterns of seasonality in information seeking encompassing all the major mental illnesses, notable also because they likely would have gone undetected using traditional surveillance.},

  abstract = {We studied the relationship between the phase and the amplitude of the circadian temperature rhythm using questionnaires that measure individual differences in personality variables, variables that relate to circadian rhythms, age and sex. The ambulatory core body temperature of 101 young men and 71 young women was recorded continuously over 6 days. The temperature minimum (Tmin) and amplitude (Tamp) were derived by fitting a complex cosine curve to each day's data for each subject. Participants completed the Horne--Ostberg Morningness--Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), the Circadian Type Inventory (CTI) and the MMPI-2, scored for the Psychopathology-5 (PSY-5) personality variables. We found that the average Tmin occurred at 03.50 h for morning-types (M-types), 05.02 h for the neither-types and 06.01 h for evening-types (E-types). Figures were presented that could provide an estimate of Tmin given an individual's morningness--eveningness score or weekend wake time. The Tmin occurred at approximately the middle of the 8-h sleep period, but it occurred closer to wake in subjects with later Tmin values and increasing eveningness. In other words, E-types slept on an earlier part of their temperature cycle than M-types. This difference in the phase-relationship between temperature and sleep may explain why E-types are more alert at bedtime and sleepier after waking than M-types. The Tmin occurred about a half-hour later for men than women. Another interesting finding included an association between circadian rhythm temperature phase and amplitude, in that subjects with more delayed phases had larger amplitudes. The greater amplitude was due to lower nocturnal temperature.},

  abstract = {Daily affect often is determined by unpredictable events, but also has predictable components. We describe how the simultaneous modeling of overall affect level, cyclical variation in affect, and the occurrence of affective events can provide a clearer understanding of how affective well-being fluctuates over time. We examined intrinsic task motivation as a positive affective event, and had an opportunity to examine a single large negative affective event as well. Specifically, data collection was interrupted by a hurricane which made landfall very close to the data collection site, disrupting the lives of employees for weeks or months. We hypothesized that affect spin---an individual difference measure of variability in the affect circumplex---would increase reactions both to positive and negative affective events. These ideas were examined with 65 employees who provided daily ratings of affect for 21 days. Positive affect was influenced by several factors, whereas negative affect was less predictable. Affect spin moderated many of the dynamic components of daily positive affect, largely supporting the notion that affect spin reflects sensitivity both to positive and negative affective events. Discussion centers on the utility of incorporating dynamic accounts of affect in the study of well-being and work. Copyright {\copyright} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Many statistical models, and in particular autoregressive---moving average time series models, can be regarded as means of transforming the data to white noise, that is, to an uncorrected sequence of errors. If the parameters are known exactly, this random sequence can be computed directly from the observations; when this calculation is made with estimates substituted for the true parameter values, the resulting sequence is referred to as the ``residuals,'' which can be regarded as estimates of the errors. If the appropriate model has been chosen, there will be zero autocorrelation in the errors. In checking adequacy of fit it is therefore logical to study the sample autocorrelation function of the residuals. For large samples the residuals from a correctly fitted model resemble very closely the true errors of the process; however, care is needed in interpreting the serial correlations of the residuals. It is shown here that the residual autocorrelations are to a close approximation representable as a singular linear transformation of the autocorrelations of the errors so that they possess a singular normal distribution. Failing to allow for this results in a tendency to overlook evidence of lack of fit. Tests of fit and diagnostic checks are devised which take these facts into account.},

  abstract = {In psychology, the use of intensive longitudinal data has steeply increased during the past decade. As a result, studying temporal dependencies in such data with autoregressive modeling is becoming common practice. However, standard autoregressive models are often suboptimal as they assume that parameters are time-invariant. This is problematic if changing dynamics (e.g., changes in the temporal dependency of a process) govern the time series. Often a change in the process, such as emotional well-being during therapy, is the very reason why it is interesting and important to study psychological dynamics. As a result, there is a need for an easily applicable method for studying such nonstationary processes that result from changing dynamics. In this article we present such a tool: the semiparametric TV-AR model. We show with a simulation study and an empirical application that the TV-AR model can approximate nonstationary processes well if there are at least 100 time points available and no unknown abrupt changes in the data. Notably, no prior knowledge of the processes that drive change in the dynamic structure is necessary. We conclude that the TV-AR model has significant potential for studying changing dynamics in psychology. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The online labor market Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is an increasingly popular source of respondents for social science research. A growing body of research has examined the demographic composition of MTurk workers as compared with that of other populations. While these comparisons have revealed the ways in which MTurk workers are and are not representative of the general population, variations among samples drawn from MTurk have received less attention. This article focuses on whether MTurk sample composition varies as a function of time. Specifically, we examine whether demographic characteristics vary by (a) time of day, (b) day of week, and serial position (i.e., earlier or later in data collection), both (c) across the entire data collection and (d) within specific batches. We find that day of week differences are minimal, but that time of day and serial position are associated with small but important variations in demographic composition. This demonstrates that MTurk samples cannot be presumed identical across different studies, potentially affecting reliability, validity, and efforts to reproduce findings.},

We compared the semiparametric time-varying autoregressive model (TV-AR) that takes into account the non-stationarity of psychological processes at the individual level, with the standard AR model.                                         Method               We conducted analyses of individual time series to assess intra-individual changes in mean levels and inertia on data from two adolescents who completed measures of personality and indicated their situation perceptions and emotions five times a day for 19~days.                                         Results               For the less honest, emotional, extraverted, and more agreeable adolescent, the TV-AR model detected reliable changes in the intra-individual dynamics of situation perceptions and emotions whereas, for the other individual, the standard AR model was more preferred, given the lack of changes in the intra-individual dynamics.

  abstract = {Model selection has different connotations in Statistics and History or Philosophy of Science. In Statistics, it has a useful but much more pedestrian role of distinguishing between two statistical models on the basis of available data. This chapter presents several examples where model selection techniques can be applied to answer scientific or statistical questions. It considers the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) in a few canonical statistical problems and state results of its statistical optimality therein. Its connection is also discussed with other model selection criteria and some of the generalizations of it. The optimality is connected with Akaike's original motivation as brought out in but it does not follow as an immediate consequence. One very important problem where AIC can be used as a model selection rule is the problem of nonparametric regression, where the functional form of dependence between the dependent variable and the regressor is not expressible in terms of finitely many unknown parameters. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is more useful in selecting a correct model while the AIC is more appropriate in finding the best model for predicting future observations.}

Conceived as a regression problem, the method is applicable to non-equidistant data, a major advantage. Another dividend is the feasibility of deriving confidence intervals for parameters of rhythmic components of known periods, readily drawn from the least squares procedure, stressing the importance of prior (external) information. Originally developed for the analysis of short and sparse data series, the extended cosinor has been further developed for the analysis of long time series, focusing both on rhythm detection and parameter estimation. Attention is given to the assumptions underlying the use of the cosinor and ways to determine whether they are satisfied. In particular, ways of dealing with non-stationary data are presented. Examples illustrate the use of the different cosinor-based methods, extending their application from the study of circadian rhythms to the mapping of broad time structures (chronomes).},

Normally measured through self-report, happiness has often been indirectly characterized and overshadowed by more readily quantifiable economic indicators such as gross domestic product. Here, we examine expressions made on the online, global microblog and social networking service Twitter, uncovering and explaining temporal variations in happiness and information levels over timescales ranging from hours to years. Our data set comprises over 46 billion words contained in nearly 4.6 billion expressions posted over a 33 month span by over 63 million unique users. In measuring happiness, we construct a tunable, real-time, remote-sensing, and non-invasive, text-based hedonometer. In building our metric, made available with this paper, we conducted a survey to obtain happiness evaluations of over 10,000 individual words, representing a tenfold size improvement over similar existing word sets. Rather than being ad hoc, our word list is chosen solely by frequency of usage, and we show how a highly robust and tunable metric can be constructed and defended.},

  abstract = {We introduce ctsem, an R package for continuous time structural equation modeling of panel (N {$>$} 1) and time series (N = 1) data, using full information maximum likelihood. Most dynamic models (e.g., cross-lagged panel models) in the social and behavioural sciences are discrete time models. An assumption of discrete time models is that time intervals between measurements are equal, and that all subjects were assessed at the same intervals. Violations of this assumption are often ignored due to the difficulty of accounting for varying time intervals, therefore parameter estimates can be biased and the time course of effects becomes ambiguous. By using stochastic differential equations to estimate an underlying continuous process, continuous time models allow for any pattern of measurement occasions. By interfacing to OpenMx, ctsem combines the flexible specification of structural equation models with the enhanced data gathering opportunities and improved estimation of continuous time models. ctsem can estimate relationships over time for multiple latent processes, measured by multiple noisy indicators with varying time intervals between observations. Within and between effects are estimated simultaneously by modeling both observed covariates and unobserved heterogeneity. Exogenous shocks with different shapes, group differences, higher order diffusion effects and oscillating processes can all be simply modeled. We first introduce and define continuous time models, then show how to specify and estimate a range of continuous time models using ctsem.},

However, this effect is not observed for utilitarian products. Additionally, our findings reveal that platform membership status moderates the impact of the `weekend effect' on online reviews, with members demonstrating more objective review behavior and reduced susceptibility to the `weekend effect'. This research expands the understanding of eWOM antecedents by incorporating temporal factors and enriches the existing body of research on the `weekend effect'. It also provides practical insights for online retailers and platforms aiming to manage and leverage online reviews effectively.},

  abstract = {Information criteria (ICs) based on penalized likelihood, such as Akaike's information criterion (AIC), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and sample-size-adjusted versions of them, are widely used for model selection in health and biological research. However, different criteria sometimes support different models, leading to discussions about which is the most trustworthy. Some researchers and fields of study habitually use one or the other, often without a clearly stated justification. They may not realize that the criteria may disagree. Others try to compare models using multiple criteria but encounter ambiguity when different criteria lead to substantively different answers, leading to questions about which criterion is best. In this paper we present an alternative perspective on these criteria that can help in interpreting their practical implications. Specifically, in some cases the comparison of two models using ICs can be viewed as equivalent to a likelihood ratio test, with the different criteria representing different alpha levels and BIC being a more conservative test than AIC. This perspective may lead to insights about how to interpret the ICs in more complex situations. For example, AIC or BIC could be preferable, depending on the relative importance one assigns to sensitivity versus specificity. Understanding the differences and similarities among the ICs can make it easier to compare their results and to use them to make informed decisions.},

Despite their broad use in model selection, the foundations of the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the corrected Akaike criterion (AICc) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) are, in general, poorly understood. The AIC, AICc and BIC penalize the likelihoods in order to select the simplest model. These criteria are based upon concepts of information and entropy, which are explained in this work, by focusing on a statistical approach. The three criteria are compared through Monte Carlo simulations, and the applications of these criteria are investigated in the selection of normal models, the selection of biological growth models and selection of time series models. For the simulation with normal models, all three criteria exhibited poor performance for a small sample size N=100 (particularly, when the variances are slightly different). For biological growth model simulations with a very small sample size N=13 the AIC and AICc showed better performance in comparison to the BIC. The simulation based on time series models produced results similar to the normal model simulations. For these simulations, the BIC exhibited superior performance, in some cases, in comparison to the other two information criteria (AIC and AICc) for a small sample size N=100, but in other cases, the BIC performed poorly, as did the AIC and AICc.},

This makes it a valuable approach for social scientists who are interested in idiographic data analysis. A fundamental time series model is the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. In this chapter we introduce the reader to the ARMA model and several extensions of it, including nonstationary models, multivariate models and nonlinear models. The focus is on the utility of these techniques for social scientists and we discuss existing applications within the social sciences to illustrate this. In the discussion we indicate how these techniques can be extended to handle multiple cases, and we briefly touch upon some valuable time series techniques which could not be treated in the current chapter.},

  abstract = {Learning objective After participating in this activity, learners should be better able to:, {$\bullet$} Discuss and outline the general and overlapping effects of the menstrual cycle on women's mental health Abstract A growing body of research demonstrates menstrual cycle--dependent fluctuations in psychiatric symptoms; these fluctuations can therefore be considered as prevalent phenomena. Possible mechanisms underlying these fluctuations posit behavioral, psychological, and neuroendocrine influences. Recent reviews document cyclic exacerbation of symptoms and explore these mechanisms in the context of specific and often single disorders. The question remains, however, as to whether there are general and overlapping effects of the menstrual cycle on women's mental health. To address this gap, we synthesized the literature examining the exacerbation of a variety of psychiatric symptoms across the menstrual cycle in adult women. Results show that the premenstrual and menstrual phases are most consistently implicated in transdiagnostic symptom exacerbation. Specifically, strong evidence indicates increases in psychosis, mania, depression, suicide/suicide attempts, and alcohol use during these phases. Anxiety, stress, and binge eating appear to be elevated more generally throughout the luteal phase. The subjective effects of smoking and cocaine use are reduced during the luteal phase, but fewer data are available for other substances. Less consistent patterns are demonstrated for panic disorder, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, and borderline personality disorder, and it is difficult to draw conclusions for symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and trichotillomania because of the limited data. Future research should focus on developing standardized approaches to identifying menstrual cycle phases and adapting pharmacological and behavioral interventions for managing fluctuations in psychiatric symptoms across the menstrual cycle.},

  abstract = {Momentary affect collected via the experience sampling method (ESM) may be characterized by circadian rhythms. To model such repetitive patterns over 24-hour cycles researchers have used cosinor analysis, which characterizes three features, namely, the intercept, amplitude, and peak offset using a cosine function. Individual differences in these parameters are of interest as they may be related to personality traits and psychopathology. Here, we raise two critical concerns about applying cosinor models to ESM data. First, some studies have used estimation methods that can yield incorrect peak offset values. This problem can be easily countered by using the correct mathematical approach. Second, since ESM data collection is limited to waking hours, the cosinor model extrapolates its 24-hour trend over periods when no data is collected due to sleep. Consequently, the model-implied peak may be projected into these gaps. This undermines the substantive utility of the peak offset parameter, and subsequently compromises the comparisons of this parameter across individuals. Using empirical data, we show that these issues affect around half of the sample. We raise a few additional concerns about the cosinor model and conclude that it should be abandoned in favor of alternative methods for addressing daytime trends in ESM data.},

This approach simplifies the specification of dynamic relationships by separating non-seasonal from seasonal factors. We illustrate this approach using the consumption model of Davidson et al. (1978), estimating a stable error correction model between consumption, income and prices over the period 1958-92. More generally, we argue that autoregressive models are unlikely to model slowly changing seasonality successfully, and may confound seasonal effects with the dynamic responses of prime interest. Our approach can be used in a wide range of cases and involves little loss in efficiency even if seasonality is deterministic.},

In this paper, we reanalyze emotion measurements from seven openly available experience sampling methodology studies with a total of 835 individuals to systematically investigate the modality (unimodal, bimodal, and more than two modes) and skewness of within-person emotion measurements. We show that both multimodality and skewness are highly prevalent. In addition, we quantify the heterogeneity across items, individuals, and measurement designs. Our analysis reveals that multimodality is more likely in studies using an analog slider scale than in studies using a Likert scale; negatively valenced items are consistently more skewed than positive valenced items; and longer time series show a higher degree of modality in positive and a higher skew in negative items. We end by discussing the implications of our results for theorizing, measurement, and time series modeling.},

We then explore the sources of weekend effects and find that workplace trust and workplace social relations, combined with differences in social time spent with family and friends, together almost fully explain the weekend effects for happiness, laughter, enjoyment and sadness, for both full-time and part-time workers, with significant but smaller proportions explained for the remaining three emotions---worry, anger and stress. Finally, we show that workplace trust and social relations significantly improve emotions and life evaluations on both weekends and weekdays for all workers.},

Quantification of the degree of day-to-day mood stability yielded wide variations between patients and suggested that patients might be usefully categorized in terms of this characteristic. Mood stability during periods of severe depression was found to be less pronounced than during periods of relatively moderate depression.

In this study, we test immediate, accumulation, and sensitisation effects of workload on fatigue within and across days using four diary studies (mean observations = 1,406; mean N = 166). In all four studies, we observed that workload had positive concurrent effects on fatigue. In addition, we found that workload had positive effects on fatigue within one day. However, there was insufficient support for short-term accumulation or sensitisation effects, implying that higher levels of workload on previous days did not directly affect or amplify the effect of workload on fatigue on that day. We discuss implications for recovery theories and potential future avenues to refine the theoretical propositions that describe intra-individual stress and recovery processes across days.},

Spectral analysis of daily mood over 84 occasions revealed a strong weekly rhythm in the temporal organization of mood in a sample of 74 undergraduates. A sine wave with a period of 7 days accounted for 40\% of the variance in the daily mood data. Individual differences were also found in how entrained subjects' moods were to this weekly rhythm. We predicted that extraverts (compared with introverts) should be less entrained to a weekly cycle. Results suggest that the novelty- and sensation-seeking behavior of extraverts most likely serves to lessen the cyclical predictability of their day-to-day moods. The origin and psychological meaning of the 7-day week are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Our study aims were to (a) identify differences in weekday versus weekend drinking, and (b) examine specific expectancies (i.e., sociability, tension reduction) and demographic factors (e.g., age, sex) relating to weekend versus weekday drinking after controlling for harmful drinking and holiday drinking. Participants were heavy-drinking noncollege attenders recruited from the community (N = 238; 63.4\% men, 35.7\% women; M age = 21.92 years). They reported daily drinking for the previous 30 days and completed measures of harmful drinking, alcohol expectancies, and demographic information. Results showed that more drinks were consumed on the weekends (i.e., Thursday to Saturday) than weekdays, with 63\% of drinks consumed on weekends. Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that weekday drinking was associated with tension-reduction expectancies, social expectancies, sex, and age. Weekend-drinking increases were related to social expectancies, but not tension-reduction expectancies. Our final model indicated that, after controlling for the effect of holiday drinking, the within-person weekday--weekend distinction explained 18\% of the total variance. In general, our findings highlight the importance of alcohol expectancies and drinking contexts in understanding the drinking behaviors of nonstudents. The differential role of tension-reduction and social-facilitation expectancies on drinking throughout the week imply that different cognitive pathways are involved in weekday versus weekend drinking, and both types of expected alcohol effects should be targets of risk-reduction efforts with nonstudent drinkers.

  abstract = {Daily diaries and other everyday experience methods are increasingly used to study relationships between two time-varying variables X and Y. Although daily data potentially often have weekly cyclical patterns (e.g., stress may be higher on weekdays and lower on weekends), the majority of daily diary studies have ignored this possibility. In this study, we investigated the effect of ignoring existing weekly cycles. We reanalyzed an empirical dataset (stress and alcohol consumption) and performed Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the impact of omitting weekly cycles. In the empirical dataset, ignoring cycles led to the inference of a significant within-person X--Y relation whereas modeling cycles suggested that this relationship did not exist. Simulation results indicated that ignoring cycles that existed in both X and Y led to bias in the estimated within-person X--Y relationship. The amount and direction of bias depended on the magnitude of the cycles, magnitude of the true within-person X--Y relation, and synchronization of the cycles. We encourage researchers conducting daily diary studies to address potential weekly cycles in their data. We provide guidelines for detecting and modeling cycles to remove their influence and discuss challenges of causal inference in daily experience studies.},

  abstract = {With improvements in technology, intensive longitudinal studies that permit the investigation of daily and weekly cycles in behavior have increased exponentially over the past few decades. Traditionally, when data have been collected on two variables over time, multivariate time series approaches that remove trends, cycles, and serial dependency have been used. These analyses permit the study of the relationship between random shocks (perturbations) in the presumed causal series and changes in the outcome series, but do not permit the study of the relationships between cycles. Liu and West (2016) proposed a multilevel approach that permitted the study of potential between subject relationships between features of the cycles in two series (e.g., amplitude). However, I show that the application of the Liu and West approach is restricted to a small set of features and types of relationships between the series. Several authors (e.g., Boker \& Graham, 1998) proposed a connected mass-spring model that appears to permit modeling of more general cyclic relationships. I showed that the undamped connected mass-spring model is also limited and may be unidentified. To test the severity of the restrictions of the motion trajectories producible by the undamped connected mass-spring model I mathematically derived their connection to the force equations of the undamped connected mass-spring system. The mathematical solution describes the domain of the trajectory pairs that are producible by the undamped connected mass-spring model. The set of producible trajectory pairs is highly restricted, and this restriction sets major limitations on the application of the connected mass-spring model to psychological data. I used a simulation to demonstrate that even if a pair of psychological time-varying variables behaved exactly like two masses in an undamped connected mass-spring system, the connected mass-spring model would not yield adequate parameter estimates. My simulation probed the performance of the connected mass-spring model as a function of several aspects of data quality including number of subjects, series length, sampling rate relative to the cycle, and measurement error in the data. The findings can be extended to damped and nonlinear connected mass-spring systems.},

There have been many hypotheses put forth over the years to explain the development of major depression, bipolar disorder, and other mood disorders. These hypotheses include disruptions in monoamine transmission, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis function, immune function, neurogenesis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuropeptide signaling (to name a few). Nearly all people suffering from mood disorders have significant disruptions in circadian rhythms and the sleep/wake cycle. In fact, altered sleep patterns are one of the major diagnostic criteria for these disorders. Moreover, environmental disruptions to circadian rhythms, including shift work, travel across time zones, and irregular social schedules, tend to precipitate or exacerbate mood-related episodes. Recent studies have found that molecular clocks are found throughout the brain and body where they participate in the regulation of most physiological processes, including those thought to be involved in mood regulation. This review will summarize recent data that implicate the circadian system as a vital regulator of a variety of systems that are thought to play a role in the development of mood disorders.},

Methods have been developed for fitting these very complex models globally and obtaining global fit statistics or global measures of their approximation to sample data. Structural equation models are idealizations that can serve only as approximations to real multivariate data. Further, these models are multidimensional, and the approximation is itself multidimensional. Tests of ``significance'' and global indices of approximation do not provide an adequate basis for judging the acceptability of the approximation. Standard applications of structural models use a composite of two models---a measurement (path) model and a path (causal) model. Separate analyses of the measurement model and the path model provide an informed judgment, whereas the composite global analysis can easily yield unreasonable conclusions. Separating the component models enables a careful assessment of the actual constraints implied by the path model, using recently developed methods. An empirical example shows how the conventional global treatment yields unacceptable conclusions.},

This paper focuses on positive affect, which is a common measure in psychological studies and for which circadian rhythm has been observed but not analyzed by modern statistical methods. The paper demonstrates that a large new analysis arsenal is available for analysis of cyclical features in intensive longitudinal data. This can help researchers extract more information from their data to get more valid estimates of coupled processes and to get new theoretical insights into circadian rhythms of mood. To assist in this effort, the analyses are based on general models with a rich set of features while still being accessible without an unduly steep learning curve.

Individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the previous 12 months (n=192) rated their mood, functional impairment, medication compliance and symptom triggers daily over 10 consecutive weeks. High mood, low mood and functional impairment were found to vary on a weekly cycle, independently of medication compliance. Low mood and functional impairment were worse on weekdays, particularly Mondays and Tuesdays, whereas mood was most elevated on Saturdays. Work-related stressors were the most common symptom triggers on weekdays, whereas sleep-related problems and positive social events were the most common triggers on weekends. This study provides evidence that individuals newly diagnosed with bipolar disorder experience fluctuations in mood and functioning that vary according to a weekly cycle.

  abstract = {Time series analysis is increasingly popular across scientific domains. A key concept in time series analysis is stationarity, the stability of statistical properties of a time series.  Understanding stationarity is crucial to addressing frequent issues in time series analysis such as the consequences of failing to model non-stationarity, how to determine the mechanisms generating non-stationarity, and consequently how to model those mechanisms (i.e. by differencing or detrending). However, many empirical researchers have limited understanding of stationarity, which can lead to the use of incorrect research practices and misleading substantive conclusions. In this paper, we address this problem by answering these questions in an accessible a way. To this end, we study how researchers can use detrending and differencing to model trends in time series analysis. We show via simulation the consequences of modeling trends inappropriately, and evaluate the performance of one popular approach to distinguish different trend types in empirical data. We present these results in an accessible way, providing an extensive introduction to key concepts in time series analysis, illustrated throughout with simple examples. Finally, we discuss a number of take-home messages and extensions to standard approaches, which directly address more complex time-series analysis problems encountered by empirical researchers.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of researchers in psychology are collecting intensive longitudinal data in order to study psychological processes on an intraindividual level. An increasingly popular way to analyze these data is autoregressive time series modeling; either by modeling the repeated measures for a single individual using classic n = 1 autoregressive models, or by using multilevel extensions of these models, with the dynamics for each individual modeled at Level 1 and interindividual differences in these dynamics modeled at Level 2. However, while it is widely accepted in psychology that psychological measurements usually contain a certain amount of measurement error, the issue of measurement error is largely neglected in applied psychological (autoregressive) time series modeling: The regular autoregressive model incorporates innovations, or ``dynamic errors,'' but not measurement error. In this article we discuss the concepts of reliability and measurement error in the context of dynamic (VAR(1)) models, and the consequences of disregarding measurement error variance in the data. For this purpose, we present a preliminary model that accounts for measurement error for constructs that are measured with a single indicator. We further discuss how this model could be used to investigate the between-person reliability of the measurements, as well as the (person-specific) within-person reliabilities and any individual differences in these reliabilities. We illustrate the consequences of assuming perfect reliability, the preliminary model, and reliabilities, using an empirical application in which we relate women's general positive affect to their positive affect concerning their romantic relationship.

Using telephone questionnaire data from a large national survey (N = 340,000), we examined day-of-week (DOW) effects on positive and negative moods. Unlike prior studies, we also tested the potential moderating effects of four demographic variables on DOW. Strong support was found for better mood on weekends and Fridays, but there was minimal support for a Blue Monday effect and no differences were observed between Saturdays and Sundays. Demographics moderated some DOW effects: DOW effects were diminished for older and retired respondents, but there was little DOW difference by gender or presence of a partner. DOW is associated with mood, but not always in ways we believe.},

By analyzing large-scale cross-national survey data collected from the Global Attitude Survey conducted by Pew Research Center in 2014--2015, this paper offers cross-national evidence focusing on reporting a good or bad day across 46 countries. It was found that daily moods show a clear weekly cycle of feeling a ``good day'' (versus ``ordinary'' or ``bad'' day), but whether one is having a ``best possible life'', a cognitive evaluation of life conditions this study uses, does not vary over the week. Religion appears to be a key explanatory factor. While Christians are not more likely to report a ``good mood'' than Muslims or those identifying with other religions, they appear to enjoy a ``best possible life'', implying stronger influences by their distinctive worldview and sense of comfort. Also, the percentage of Christians in the whole population constitutes a very important structural context, such that in Christian-majority countries, Saturday and Sunday generated more good day reports than elsewhere. Muslim societies produce a very delightful context on Fridays. Other social structural conditions such as national wealth or income distribution generate mixed evidence. Policy implications are discussed in the conclusion.},

For model specification, the package performs structural specification to overcome the difficulties of identifiability of VARMA models. The methods used for structural specification include Kronecker indices and Scalar Component Models. (b) For multivariate volatility modeling, the MTS package handles several commonly used models, including multivariate exponentially weighted moving-average volatility, Cholesky decomposition volatility models, dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) models, copula-based volatility models, and low-dimensional BEKK models. The package also considers multiple tests for conditional heteroscedasticity, including rank-based statistics. (c) Finally, the MTS package also performs forecasting using diffusion index , transfer function analysis, Bayesian estimation of VAR models, and multivariate time series analysis with missing values.Users can also use the package to simulate VARMA models, to compute impulse response functions of a fitted VARMA model, and to calculate theoretical cross-covariance matrices of a given VARMA model.},

This paper describes body weight fluctuation patterns in response to weekly, holiday (Christmas) and seasonal time periods in a large group of individuals engaged in a weight loss maintenance intervention. Methods Data was collected as part The NoHoW Project which was a pan-European weight loss maintenance trial. Three eligible groups were defined for weekly, holiday and seasonal analyses, resulting in inclusion of 1,421, 1,062 and 1,242 participants, respectively. Relative weight patterns were modelled on a time series following removal of trends and grouped by gender, country, BMI and age. Results Within-week fluctuations of 0.35\% were observed, characterised by weekend weight gain and weekday reduction which differed between all groups. Over the Christmas period, weight increased by a mean 1.35\% and was not fully compensated for in following months, with some differences between countries observed. Seasonal patterns were primarily characterised by the effect of Christmas weight gain and generally not different between groups. Conclusions This evidence may improve current understanding of regular body weight fluctuation patterns and help target future weight management interventions towards periods, and in groups, where weight gain is anticipated.},

Although having a number of benefits over other methods, the use and analysis of AA data may pose specific challenges. Among these, the issue of dealing with diurnal cycles in emotion data has received relative scant attention. This article therefore discusses why cyclic models may be considered for analyzing AA data on emotions, and describes how this approach can be applied to an empirical AA dataset. Results suggest that cyclic modeling may be a useful method for describing and accounting for (diurnal) cyclic patterns in AA data, but should be used with a number of considerations in mind.},

The focus is on latent variable models, given their growing use in theory testing and construction. Theoretical statistical results in regression are discussed, and more important issues are illustrated with novel simulations involving latent variable models including factor analysis, latent profile analysis, and factor mixture models. Asymptotically, the BIC is consistent, in that it will select the true model if, among other assumptions, the true model is among the candidate models considered. The AIC is not consistent under these circumstances. When the true model is not in the candidate model set the AIC is efficient, in that it will asymptotically choose whichever model minimizes the mean squared error of prediction/estimation. The BIC is not efficient under these circumstances. Unlike the BIC, the AIC also has a minimax property, in that it can minimize the maximum possible risk in finite sample sizes. In sum, the AIC and BIC have quite different properties that require different assumptions, and applied researchers and methodologists alike will benefit from improved understanding of the asymptotic and finite-sample behavior of these criteria. The ultimate decision to use the AIC or BIC depends on many factors, including the loss function employed, the study's methodological design, the substantive research question, and the notion of a true model and its applicability to the study at hand.

Current practice in cognitive psychology is to accept a single model on the basis of only the ``raw'' AIC values, making it difficult to unambiguously interpret the observed AIC differences in terms of a continuous measure such as probability. Here we demonstrate that AIC values can be easily transformed to so-called Akaike weights (e.g., Akaike, 1978, 1979; Bozdogan, 1987; Burnham \& Anderson, 2002), which can be directly interpreted as conditional probabilities for each model. We show by example how these Akaike weights can greatly facilitate the interpretation of the results of AIC model comparison procedures.},

Issues related to nonindependence of observations, the nature of data structures, and claims of causality are considered. Through the analysis of data from a single subject, we illustrate concomitant time-series analysis, a general method of examining relationships between two or more series having 50 or more observations. We also discuss detection of and remedies for the problems of trend, cycles, and serial dependency that frequently plague temporal data, and present methods of combining the results of concomitant time series across subjects. Issues that arise in pooling cross-sectional and time-series data and statistical models for addressing these issues are considered for the case in which there are appreciably fewer than 50 observations and a moderate number of subjects. We discuss the possibility of using structural equation modeling to analyze data structures in which there are a large number (e.g., 200) of subjects, but relatively few time points, emphasizing the different causal status of synchronous and lagged effects and the types of models that can be specified for longitudinal data structures. Our conclusion highlights some of the issues raised by temporal data for statistical models, notably the important roles of substantive theory, the question being addressed, the properties of the data, and the assumptions underlying each technique in determining the optimal approach to statistical analysis.},

  abstract = {Inertia, the resistance of an ecosystem property to change under stress, is distinguished from resilience, which refers to the degree, manner, and pace of change or recovery in ecosystem properties following disturbance. In turn, these two terms are differentiated from `stability', which is used here to refer to the pattern of natural fluctuation in ecosystem properties in the absence of major exogenous disturbance. Four component attributes of resilience are reviewed in the context of Mediterranean-climate examples. The elasticity component concerns the rate of recovery of an ecosystem property following disturbance; amplitude, the threshold of stress beyond which recovery to the initial state does not occur; hysteresis, the degree to which the pattern of recovery after stress differs from that of deterioration under chronic stress, and malleability, the ease with which the ecosystem can become permanently altered. Each ecosystem property will typically reveal a different level of resilience to a given stress and stressor. The degree of recovery should not be expected to be complete in any event, due to sample variability and stochastic events. In cyclically-stable ecosystems, the pattern of recovery should be measured in light of this periodicity, and short-term (within-cycle) recovery distinguished from long-term (between-cycle) recovery. The prediction of resilience properties of ecosystems can be approached through a knowledge of the modular structure of foodwebs, through knowledge of the autecological adaptations of key species to the stressor, or through cumulative experience of the response to disturbance at the community level. At present there is much room for investigation of each of these approaches in Mediterranean-climate ecosystems.},

Can the pursuit of the true model also lead to optimal regression estimation? In model selection, it is well known that BIC is consistent in selecting the true model, and AIC is minimax-rate optimal for estimating the regression function. A recent promising direction is adaptive model selection, in which, in contrast to AIC and BIC, the penalty term is data-dependent. Some theoretical and empirical results have been obtained in support of adaptive model selection, but it is still not clear if it can really share the strengths of AIC and BIC. Model combining or averaging has attracted increasing attention as a means to overcome the model selection uncertainty. Can Bayesian model averaging be optimal for estimating the regression function in a minimax sense? We show that the answers to these questions are basically in the negative: for any model selection criterion to be consistent, it must behave suboptimally for estimating the regression function in terms of minimax rate of covergence; and Bayesian model averaging cannot be minimax-rate optimal for regression estimation.}

The current paper summarizes findings on brain adaptations associated with seasonal changes, factors that contribute to individual differences and their implications for psychiatric disorders. Changes in circadian rhythms are likely to prominently mediate these seasonal effects since light strongly entrains the internal clock modifying brain function. Inability of circadian rhythms to accommodate to seasonal changes might increase the risk for mood and behavior problems as well as worse clinical outcomes in psychiatric disorders. Understanding the mechanisms that account for inter-individual variations in seasonality is relevant to the development of individualized prevention and treatment for psychiatric disorders. Despite promising findings, seasonal effects are still understudied and only controlled as a covariate in most brain research. Rigorous neuroimaging studies with thoughtful experimental designs, powered sample sizes and high temporal resolution alongside deep characterization of the environment are needed to better understand the seasonal adaptions of the human brain as a function of age, sex, and geographic latitude and to investigate the mechanisms underlying the alterations in seasonal adaptation in psychiatric disorders.},
