  abstract = {We studied the relationship between the phase and the amplitude of the circadian temperature rhythm using questionnaires that measure individual differences in personality variables, variables that relate to circadian rhythms, age and sex. The ambulatory core body temperature of 101 young men and 71 young women was recorded continuously over 6 days. The temperature minimum (Tmin) and amplitude (Tamp) were derived by fitting a complex cosine curve to each day's data for each subject. Participants completed the Horne--Ostberg Morningness--Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), the Circadian Type Inventory (CTI) and the MMPI-2, scored for the Psychopathology-5 (PSY-5) personality variables. We found that the average Tmin occurred at 03.50 h for morning-types (M-types), 05.02 h for the neither-types and 06.01 h for evening-types (E-types). Figures were presented that could provide an estimate of Tmin given an individual's morningness--eveningness score or weekend wake time. The Tmin occurred at approximately the middle of the 8-h sleep period, but it occurred closer to wake in subjects with later Tmin values and increasing eveningness. In other words, E-types slept on an earlier part of their temperature cycle than M-types. This difference in the phase-relationship between temperature and sleep may explain why E-types are more alert at bedtime and sleepier after waking than M-types. The Tmin occurred about a half-hour later for men than women. Another interesting finding included an association between circadian rhythm temperature phase and amplitude, in that subjects with more delayed phases had larger amplitudes. The greater amplitude was due to lower nocturnal temperature.},

  abstract = {Night gaps are inherent to data obtained with the experience sampling method (ESM). When such data are used to study lagged relations between variables--such as autoregression within the same variable, and cross-lagged regressions between different variables--the actual role of night gaps is typically not investigated. However, there are various methods to handle them in analyses. Common solutions involve: (1) ignoring the night gap by considering the night interval as a regular interval; (2) removing the night gap by not regressing the first measurement of the day on the last measurement of the previous day; or (3) treating the night gap as a missing data problem. The goal of this paper is to make explicit the theoretical implications of these three methods within the context of the first-order autoregressive (AR[1]) model. Additionally, we propose an alternative modeling approach that allows us to study the implications of the night gap in more detail. Moreover, given that the current methods are special cases of the proposed alternative, we can test which method best describes the process of interest. Through an empirical N=1 example with various ESM variables, we demonstrate that the best-fitting method differs per variable. This implies that some processes may exhibit different dynamics during the night than during the daytime, providing a stepping stone to understanding and modeling night gaps in ESM.},

However, in these studies, the effects of extended wakefulness and circadian phase remained confounded, and the interaction of these 2 processes could not be assessed quantitatively.In the present study, a total of 24 healthy young subjects (16 men, 8 women) lived on a 30-hour sleep-wake schedule for 19 to 23 days or on a 28-hour sleep-wake schedule for 33 to 36 days; both schedules induced desynchrony between the subjects' sleep-wake cycle and their endogenous circadian pacemaker. Subjective mood was assessed by 2 types of visual analog scales, which were administered twice every 2 hours and every 20 minutes, respectively, during all scheduled wake fulness episodes. A circadian phase and an interval elapsed since awakening were attributed to each data point, and circadian and wake-dependent fluctuations of mood were assessed.A significant variation of mood with circadian phase was observed, but no reliable main effect of the duration of prior wakefulness was found. A statistically significant interaction of circadian and wake-dependent fluctuations was evident; when the analysis was restricted to specific circadian phases, mood improved, deteriorated, or remained stable with the duration of prior wakefulness.These results indicate that, in healthy young subjects, subjective mood is influenced by a complex and nonadditive interaction of circadian phase and duration of prior wakefulness. The nature of this interaction is such that moderate changes in the timing of the sleep-wake cycle may have profound effects on subsequent mood.}

Conceived as a regression problem, the method is applicable to non-equidistant data, a major advantage. Another dividend is the feasibility of deriving confidence intervals for parameters of rhythmic components of known periods, readily drawn from the least squares procedure, stressing the importance of prior (external) information. Originally developed for the analysis of short and sparse data series, the extended cosinor has been further developed for the analysis of long time series, focusing both on rhythm detection and parameter estimation. Attention is given to the assumptions underlying the use of the cosinor and ways to determine whether they are satisfied. In particular, ways of dealing with non-stationary data are presented. Examples illustrate the use of the different cosinor-based methods, extending their application from the study of circadian rhythms to the mapping of broad time structures (chronomes).},

  abstract = {The interpretation of the effect of predictors in projected normal regression models is not straight-forward. The main aim of this paper is to make this interpretation easier such that these models can be employed more readily by social scientific researchers. We introduce three new measures: the slope at the inflection point (bc), average slope (AS) and slope at mean (SAM) that help us assess the marginal effect of a predictor in a Bayesian projected normal regression model. The SAM or AS are preferably used in situations where the data for a specific predictor do not lie close to the inflection point of a circular regression curve. In this case bc is an unstable and extrapolated effect. In addition, we outline how the projected normal regression model allows us to distinguish between an effect on the mean and spread of a circular outcome variable. We call these types of effects location and accuracy effects, respectively. The performance of the three new measures and of the methods to distinguish between location and accuracy effects is investigated in a simulation study. We conclude that the new measures and methods to distinguish between accuracy and location effects work well in situations with a clear location effect. In situations where the location effect is not clearly distinguishable from an accuracy effect not all measures work equally well and we recommend the use of the SAM.},

Rare studies investigated the associations of circadian rhythms of the HRV indices with the stress, mood, and sleep conditions in populations under stress. In total 257 female participants (203 shift workers and 54 non-shift workers) were included. All the participants completed a structured questionnaire to assess the stress, mood, and sleep conditions and performed 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram monitoring on the day away from shifts. Using epochs of 1-min or 5-min beat-to-beat intervals, the HRV indices (SDNN, RMSSD, LF, HF, LF/HF, and LFnu, SD1, SD2, SD1/SD2) were plotted as a function of time and fitted into cosine periodic curves, respectively. Three mathematical parameters based on the cosine periodic curves were extracted, MESOR (M, overall averages of the cosine curve), amplitude (A, amplitude of the peak of the cosine curve), and acrophase ({\texttheta}, latency to the peak) to quantify the circadian rhythms of the HRV indices. Multivariable linear regression models were used to reveal the associations of these parameters with the clinical assessments of stress, mood, or sleep conditions, as well as with the 24-h averages of the HRV indices. The parameters M and A of SDNN, RMSSD, LF, and HF, and {\texttheta} of LF/HF and LFnu significantly differ between shift and non-shift workers. The parameter {\texttheta} of LF/HF positively correlates with the severity of stress and anxiety. The parameter A of LF/HF and LFnu also positively correlates with daytime sleepiness and sleep fragmentation. In addition, the parameters M and A instead of {\texttheta} of SDNN, RMSSD, LF, LF/HF, and LFnu significantly correlate with the 24-h averages of HRV indices. The circadian rhythms of the HRV indices over 24 hours can, to some extent, predict the severity of stress, emotion and sleep conditions in female populations under stress.},

In this research, we examine within-person fluctuations in emotion differentiation and hypothesize that stress is a central factor in predicting these fluctuations. We predict that experiencing stress will result in lower levels of emotion differentiation. Using data from a 3-wave longitudinal experience sampling study, we examined the within-person fluctuations in the level of emotion differentiation across days and months and tested if these fluctuations related to changes in stress levels. On the day-level, we found that differentiation of negative emotions varied significantly within individuals, that high stress levels were associated with lower levels of emotion differentiation, and that stress on 1 day negatively predicted the level of differentiation of negative emotions on a next day (but not vice versa). On the wave-level, we found a concurrent, but not a prospective relationship between stress and emotion differentiation. These results are the first to directly demonstrate the role of stress in predicting fluctuations in emotion differentiation and have implications for our theoretical understanding of emotion differentiation, as well as for interventions.

  abstract = {Daily diary data of emotional experiences are typically modeled with a first-order autoregressive model to account for possible day-to-day dynamics. However, our emotional experiences are likely to be affected by the weekly rhythm of our activities, which may be reflected by: (a) day-of-week effects (DOWEs), where different days of the week are characterized by different means; and (b) week-to-week dynamics, where weekday-specific activities and experiences have a delayed effect on the emotions that we experience on the same weekday a week later. While DOWEs have been studied occasionally, week-to-week dynamics have been largely ignored in psychological research. To gain more insight in the various regularities that may exist in daily diary data, we begin with presenting a set of complementary visualization techniques that can help to detect and characterize weekly rhythms and day-to-day dynamics in time series data. Subsequently, we introduce the family of seasonal autoregressive--moving average (SARMA) models from the econometrics literature, and extend this with models for the DOWEs. We illustrate how the different model components show up in the various visualizations of the time series data. We then provide a tutorial on fitting these models in R, discussing model fit and model selection, and apply this to a daily diary dataset consisting of 56-101 daily measures from 98 individuals. The results suggests that most individuals in the sample are characterized by patterns and dynamics that the current practices in psychological research cannot capture adequately. We discuss the implications of our findings for current psychological research practices.},

Temperatures (n= 93,225) were collected using temporal artery thermometers from a Boston emergency department during 2009--2012 and were statistically analyzed using regression with cyclic splines. The overall mean body temperature was 36.7{$^\circ$}C (98.1{$^\circ$}F), with a 95\% confidence interval of 36.7--36.7{$^\circ$}C (98.1--98.1{$^\circ$}F) and a standard deviation of 0.6{$^\circ$}C (1.1{$^\circ$}F). Over the day, mean body temperature followed a steady cycle, reaching its minimum at 6:00--8:00 and its maximum at 18:00--20:00. Across days of the week, this diurnal cycle was essentially unchanged, even though activities and sleeping hours change substantially during the weekly cycles of human behavior. Over the year, body temperatures were slightly colder in winter than summer ( 0.2{$^\circ$}C difference), consistent with most prior studies. We propose these seasonal differences might be due to ambient effects on body temperature that are not eliminated because they fall within the tolerance range of the thermoregulatory system. Over the year, bathyphase (daily time of minimum temperature) appeared to parallel sunrise times, as expected from sunrise's zeitgeber role in circadian rhythms. However, orthophase (daily time of maximum temperature) and sunset times followed opposite seasonal patterns, with orthophase preceding nightfall in summer and following nightfall in winter. Throughout the year, bathyphase and orthophase remained separated by approximately 12 h, suggesting this interval might be conserved. Finally, although 37.0{$^\circ$}C (98.6{$^\circ$}F) is widely recognized as the mean or normal human body temperature, analysis showed mean temperature was {$<$}37.0{$^\circ$}C during all times of day, days of the week, and seasons of the year, supporting prior arguments that the 37.0{$^\circ$}C standard has no scientific basis. Overall, this large study showed robust and consistent behavior of the human circadian cycle at the population level, providing a strong example of circadian homeostasis.},

Two hundred and twenty-one normal subjects recorded peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at home four times a day for seven days. Rhythm detection was statistically significant in 145 of them (65.6\%) who showed a mean amplitude of 8.3\% of individual mean PEFR (+/- SD 5.2\%). Amplitude was independent of age, sex, atopy, family history of asthma, and smoking habit. Fifteen of them were also studied three times a day for five days in the laboratory with flow-volume loops. Eleven showed significant PEFR rhythms at home. No single measurement from the flow-volume loop showed periodicity in as many of them but rhythms were now also detected in the other four normal subjects in some components of the loop. Fifty-six asthma patients were studied with a similar protocol of PEFR measurement and compared with the 145 rhythmic normal subjects. Mean phases of the normal and asthmatic rhythms were not significantly different with acrophases (peak of rhythm cycle) at 1557 and 1526 respectively. The mean asthmatic amplitude was, however, significantly greater at 50.9\%. Nocturnal asthma, therefore, probably represents an exaggeration of a normal circadian rhythm in airway calibre. The amplitude of the PEFR rhythm is an index of bronchial lability and is thus valuable in monitoring asthma patients. An amplitude of greater than 20\% should be a useful screening test for asthma.},

  abstract = {Circular data can arise from different measurement scales like the compass and the clock. Although such data may arise more often in fields like biology and environmental sciences, also in the social and behavioral sciences researchers are occasionally confronted with circular measurements. Examples of circular data representing directions in degrees or radians are, for instance, found in human movement psychology and cognitive psychology. Examples are studies using a moving room experiment [36], experiments on bimanual coordination [23], and studies on spatial cognition and learning [28]. The outcome of interest in such studies often is an angular deviation, that is, the observed response is compared to the correct response. The first illustration in this chapter uses data of the study by Bullens et al. [5] which is also an example from the field of spatial cognition.},

Although daily data potentially often have weekly cyclical patterns (e.g., stress may be higher on weekdays and lower on weekends), the majority of daily diary studies have ignored this possibility. In this study, we investigated the effect of ignoring existing weekly cycles. We reanalyzed an empirical dataset (stress and alcohol consumption) and performed Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the impact of omitting weekly cycles. In the empirical dataset, ignoring cycles led to the inference of a significant within-person X--Y relation whereas modeling cycles suggested that this relationship did not exist. Simulation results indicated that ignoring cycles that existed in both X and Y led to bias in the estimated within-person X--Y relationship. The amount and direction of bias depended on the magnitude of the cycles, magnitude of the true within-person X--Y relation, and synchronization of the cycles. We encourage researchers conducting daily diary studies to address potential weekly cycles in their data. We provide guidelines for detecting and modeling cycles to remove their influence and discuss challenges of causal inference in daily experience studies.},

  abstract = {In regression modelling the non-linear relationships between explanatory variables and outcome are often effectively modelled using restricted cubic splines (RCS). We focus on situations where the values of the outcome change periodically over time and we define an extension of RCS that considers periodicity by introducing numerical constraints. Practical examples include the estimation of seasonal variations, a common aim in virological research, or the study of hormonal fluctuations within menstrual cycle. Using real and simulated data with binary outcomes we show that periodic RCS can perform better than other methods proposed for periodic data. They greatly reduce the variability of the estimates obtained at the extremes of the period compared to cubic spline methods and require the estimation of fewer parameters; cosinor models perform similarly to the best cubic spline model and their estimates are generally less variable, but only if an appropriate number of harmonics is used. Periodic RCS provide a useful extension of RCS for periodic data when the assumption of equality of the outcome at the beginning and end of the period is scientifically sensible. The implementation of periodic RCS is freely available in peRiodiCS R package and the paper presents examples of their usage for the modelling of the seasonal occurrence of the viruses.},

  abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) fluctuates throughout the day. The pattern it follows represents one of the most important circadian rhythms in the human body. For example, morning BP surge has been suggested as a potential risk factor for cardiovascular events occurring in the morning, but the accurate quantification of this phenomenon remains a challenge. Here, we outline a novel method to quantify morning surge. We demonstrate how the most commonly used method to model 24-hour BP, the single cosinor approach, can be extended to a multiple-component cosinor random-effects model. We outline how this model can be used to obtain a measure of morning BP surge by obtaining derivatives of the model fit. The model is compared with a functional principal component analysis that determines the main components of variability in the data. Data from the Mitchelstown Study, a population-based study of Irish adults (n = 2047), were used where a subsample (1207) underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. We demonstrate that our 2-component model provided a significant improvement in fit compared with a single model and a similar fit to a more complex model captured by b-splines using functional principal component analysis. The estimate of the average maximum slope was 2.857 mmHg/30 min (bootstrap estimates; 95\% CI: 2.855-2.858 mmHg/30 min). Simulation results allowed us to quantify the between-individual SD in maximum slopes, which was 1.02 mmHg/30 min. By obtaining derivatives we have demonstrated a novel approach to quantify morning BP surge and its variation between individuals. This is the first demonstration of cosinor approach to obtain a measure of morning surge.},

Topics covered include tests of uniformity, tests of good-of-fit, inference on von Mises distributions and non-parametric methods. The second part considers statistics on spheres of arbitrary dimension, and includes a detailed account of inference on the main distributions on spheres. Recent material on correlation, regression time series, robust techniques, bootstrap methods, density estimation and curve fitting is presented. The third part considers statistics on more general sample spaces, in particular rotation groups, Stiefel manifolds, Grassmann manifolds and complex projective spaces. Shape analysis is considered from the perspective of directional statistics. Written by leading authors in the field, this text will be invaluable not only to researchers in probability and statistics interested in the latest developments in directional statistics, but also to practitioners and researchers in many scientific fields, including astronomy, biology, computer vision, earth sciences and image analysis.},

The non-linear transformation is the sigmoidal family, represented here by three family members: the Hill function, the anti-logistic function, and the arctangent function. These transforms add two additional parameters that must be estimated, in addition to the acrophase, MESOR, and amplitude (and period in some applications), but the estimated curves have shapes requiring many more than two additional harmonics to achieve the same fit when modelled by harmonic regression. Particular values of the additional parameters can yield rectangular waves, narrow pulses, wide pulses, and for rectangular waves (representing alternating `on' and `off' states) the times of onset and offset (hence duration, as when modelling the duration of the large night-time melatonin secretory epoch). We illustrate the sigmoidally transformed cosine curves, and compare them to harmonic regression modelling, in a sample of eight activity recordings made on patients in a nursing home.

There have been many hypotheses put forth over the years to explain the development of major depression, bipolar disorder, and other mood disorders. These hypotheses include disruptions in monoamine transmission, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis function, immune function, neurogenesis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuropeptide signaling (to name a few). Nearly all people suffering from mood disorders have significant disruptions in circadian rhythms and the sleep/wake cycle. In fact, altered sleep patterns are one of the major diagnostic criteria for these disorders. Moreover, environmental disruptions to circadian rhythms, including shift work, travel across time zones, and irregular social schedules, tend to precipitate or exacerbate mood-related episodes. Recent studies have found that molecular clocks are found throughout the brain and body where they participate in the regulation of most physiological processes, including those thought to be involved in mood regulation. This review will summarize recent data that implicate the circadian system as a vital regulator of a variety of systems that are thought to play a role in the development of mood disorders.},

In a frequentist setting, this type of model is plagued by the likelihood surface of its regression coefficients, which is not logarithmically concave. In a Bayesian context, a weakly informative prior solves this issue, while for other parametersnoninformative priors are available. In addition to an MCMC sampling algorithm, we develop Bayesian hypothesis tests based on the Bayes factor for both equality and inequality constrained hypotheses. In a simulation study, it can be seen that our method performs well. The analyses are available in the package CircGLMBayes. Finally, we apply this model to a dataset from experimental psychology, and show that it provides valuable insight for applied researchers.

Procedure The International Society for Bipolar Disorders Chronobiology Task Force conducted a critical integrative review of circadian methods that have real-world applicability. Consensus discussion led to the selection of three domains to review---melatonin assessment, actigraphy, and self-report. Results Measurement approaches used to quantify circadian function in BD are described in sufficient detail for researchers and clinicians to make pragmatic decisions about their use. A novel integration of the measurement literature is offered in the form of a provisional taxonomy distinguishing between circadian measures (the instruments and methods used to quantify circadian function, such as dim light melatonin onset) and circadian constructs (the biobehavioral processes to be measured, such as circadian phase). Conclusions Circadian variables are an important target of measurement in clinical practice and biomarker research. To improve reproducibility and clinical application of circadian constructs, an informed systematic approach to measurement is required. We trust that this review will decrease ambiguity in the literature and support theory-based consideration of measurement options.},

These findings direct attention to individual difference in susceptibility to continuous work periods and suggest that 24-h rhythms in some performance and physiological measures perhaps are more readily responsive to an altered wake/sleep cycle than other circadian rhythms.},

  abstract = {A fundamental interest in chronobiology is to compare patterns between groups of rhythmic data. However, many existing methods are ill-equipped to derive statements concerning the statistical significance of differences between rhythms that may be visually apparent. This is attributed to both the form of data used (longitudinal versus cross-sectional) and the limitations of the statistical tests used to draw conclusions.To address this problem, we propose that a cosinusoidal curve with a particular parametrization be used to model and compare data of two sets of observations collected over a 24-h period. The novelty of our test is in the parametrization, which allows the explicit estimation of rhythmic parameters [mesor (the rhythm-adjusted mean level of a response variable around which a wave function oscillates), amplitude and phase], and simultaneously testing for statistical significance in all three parameters between two or more groups of datasets. A statistically significant difference between two groups, regarding each of these rhythmic parameters, is indicated by a P-value. The method is evaluated by applying the model to publicly available datasets, and is further exemplified by comparison to the currently recommended method, DODR. The results suggest that the method proposed may be highly sensitive to detect rhythmic differences between groups in phase, amplitude and mesor.https://github.com/RWParsons/circacompare/},

  abstract = {Non invasive blood pressure monitoring using an automatic Nippon Colin recorder was performed in 20 hospitalized hypertensive patients every 15 min during a 4-day study period. A chronobiologic analysis of the data was performed in order to test the consistency of the whole-day blood pressure pattern. Halberg's method of single cosinor was used to determine the values and the confidence limits of the following parameters of 24-hour rhythmic changes: mesor (rhythm-adjusted 24-hour average), amplitude (24-hour variability estimate), acrophase (clock hour of maximum BP level). The variation of the above parameters during the four 24-hour periods was found to be within 9 mmHg for the systolic mesor, 6 mmHg for the diastolic mesor, 5 mmHg for the systolic amplitude, 4 mmHg for the diastolic amplitude, 55 min for the systolic acrophase, 60 min for the diastolic acrophase. The same parameters were also calculated in 48-hour, 72-hour and 96-hour long time series, and with different sampling periods (30, 60, 120 min). The length of the monitoring span did not influence significantly the values of the rhythm parameters only when 15-min or 30-min sampling periods were used. The widths of the 95\% confidence limits of amplitude and acrophase were significantly narrower in the 2-day than in the 1-day series. Further lengthening of the monitoring span from 2 to 4 days resulted in a much smaller additional narrowing of the confidence limits. Sampling periods longer than 30 min caused a loss of sensitivity in rhythm detection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {The master biological clock situated in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus plays a vital role in orchestrating the circadian rhythms of multiple biological processes. Increasing evidence points to a role of the biological clock in the development of depression. In seasonal depression and in bipolar disorders it seems likely that the circadian system plays a vital role in the genesis of the disorder. For major unipolar depressive disorder (MDD) available data suggest a primary involvement of the circadian system but further and larger studies are necessary to conclude. Melatonin and melatonin agonists have chronobiotic effects, which mean that they can readjust the circadian system. Seasonal affective disorders and mood disturbances caused by circadian malfunction are theoretically treatable by manipulating the circadian system using chronobiotic drugs, chronotherapy or bright light therapy. In MDD, melatonin alone has no antidepressant action but novel melatoninergic compounds demonstrate antidepressant properties. Of these, the most advanced is the novel melatonin agonist agomelatine, which combines joint MT1 and MT2 agonism with 5-HT2C receptor antagonism. Adding a chronobiotic effect to the inhibition of 5-HT2C receptors may explain the rapid impact of agomelatine on depression, since studies showed that agomelatine had an early impact on sleep quality and alertness at awakening. Further studies are necessary in order to better characterize the effect of agomelatine and other novel melatoninergic drugs on the circadian system of MDD patients. In summary, antidepressants with intrinsic chronobiotic properties offer a novel approach to treatment of depression.},

Applications of relevance include forecasting volumes of call centre arrivals, transportation, e-mail traffic and electricity loads. The first method that we develop extends an exponential smoothing formulation that has been used for daily sales data, and which involves smoothing the total weekly volume and its split across the periods of the week. Two new methods are proposed that use discount weighted regression (DWR). The first uses DWR to estimate the time-varying parameters of a model with trigonometric terms. The second introduces DWR splines. We also consider a time-varying spline that uses exponential smoothing. The final new method presented here involves the use of singular value decomposition followed by exponential smoothing. Empirical results are provided using a series of intraday call centre arrivals.},

  abstract = {The seasonal cycle (SC) of surface air temperature is a substantial element in climatology. Some basic and important topics in climate change studies are based on accurate and reliable estimation of SCs, such as percentile-based indices of extremes and probability density function (PDF) changes of daily temperatures. For both of them, most studies characterized SCs using averages of multi-days windows, which is not smooth and accurate enough representing the extreme thresholds and climatological normal of SCs. It is necessary to construct smooth and reasonable SCs for more accurate estimation of temperature changes on extreme thresholds and PDFs. In this study, we propose a flexible method based on generalized additive models for location scale and shape and penalized b-spline smoothing technique with respective distributions to construct smooth SCs and SC for extreme temperatures (SCETs). The accuracy of the constructed smooth SCETs is good with the estimation biases of percentiles tending to be zero. The constructed smooth SCET also exhibits good stability over time, such that the magnitude changes of temperatures on each calendar day are close to climatic changes of mean temperature when the concerned period shifts. Based on the constructed smooth SCs, climatic changes by seasons and PDFs between two periods, 1961--1990 and 1991--2020, are examined over China. The increase of thresholds for hot extremes in spring during the recent period is prominent, while the increase of thresholds for daytime cold extremes in summer over a part of central to southern China is also notable. The smooth SCs and SCETs based on our flexible statistical modelling framework can characterize daily extreme temperatures reasonably and accurately, and should be expected to have more applications for a better understanding of climate changes related to distributions and seasonal cycles.},

Based on secondary analyses on an existing EMA data set, it can be concluded that adding cyclic terms in EMA analyses may improve model fit and may help understanding the dynamic processes.},

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms are internal manifestations of the solar day that permit adaptations to predictable environmental temporal changes. These {\textasciitilde}24-h rhythms are controlled by molecular clockworks within the brain that are reset daily to precisely 24\,h by exposure to the light--dark cycle. Information from the master clock in the mammalian hypothalamus conveys temporal information to the entire body via humoral and neural communication. A bidirectional relationship exists between mood disorders and circadian rhythms. Mood disorders are often associated with disrupted circadian clock-controlled responses, such as sleep and cortisol secretion, whereas disruption of circadian rhythms via jet lag, night-shift work, or exposure to artificial light at night, can precipitate or exacerbate affective symptoms in susceptible individuals. Evidence suggests strong associations between circadian rhythms and mental health, but only recently have studies begun to discover the direct interactions between the circadian system and mood regulation. This review provides an overview of disrupted circadian rhythms and the relationship to behavioral health and psychiatry. The focus of this review is delineating the role of disruption of circadian rhythms on mood disorders using human night shift studies, as well as jet lag studies to identify links. We also review animal models of disrupted circadian rhythms on affective responses. Lastly, we propose low-cost behavioral and lifestyle changes to improve circadian rhythms and presumably behavioral health.},

  abstract = {Circadian clocks drive cyclic variations in many aspects of physiology, but some daily variations are evoked by periodic changes in the environment or sleep--wake state and associated behaviors, such as changes in posture, light levels, fasting or eating, rest or activity and social interactions; thus, it is often important to quantify the relative contributions of these factors. Yet, circadian rhythms and these evoked effects cannot be separated under typical 24-h day conditions, because circadian phase and the length of time awake or asleep co-vary. Nathaniel Kleitman's forced desynchrony (FD) protocol was designed to assess endogenous circadian rhythmicity and to separate circadian from evoked components of daily rhythms in multiple parameters. Under FD protocol conditions, light intensity is kept low to minimize its impact on the circadian pacemaker, and participants have sleep--wake state and associated behaviors scheduled to an imposed non-24-h cycle. The period of this imposed cycle, {$T$}, is chosen so that the circadian pacemaker cannot entrain to it and therefore continues to oscillate at its intrinsic period ({$\tau$}, {\textasciitilde}24.15 h), ensuring circadian components are separated from evoked components of daily rhythms. Here we provide detailed instructions and troubleshooting techniques on how to design, implement and analyze the data from an FD protocol. We provide two procedures: one with general guidance for designing an FD study and another with more precise instructions for replicating one of our previous FD studies. We discuss estimating circadian parameters and quantifying the separate contributions of circadian rhythmicity and the sleep--wake cycle, including statistical analysis procedures and an R package for conducting the non-orthogonal spectral analysis method that enables an accurate estimation of period, amplitude and phase.},
